# COM212Final Project

In this project we will create a console-based social networking profile that focuses on a single user’s
account details, events, friends, and a timeline of posts. It will run in the terminal or command prompt,
and will store the user’s profile data in a single text file. This project will act as a simplified component
of a larger social networking platform that manages many user profiles with a mobile app or a web-based
user interface and a database that stores the data on a web server. In this project, our platform will focus
on a single user instance, with a defined set of interactions.
